#Project 1 MAE 598 at ASU#

This repo is for all code relating to the first project in MAE 598.

The project is to solve the heat equation using both the Forward Euler and the Crank-Nicolson methods for solving the second order ODE.  Then to run the code for various domain sizes in order to see how the methods scale.
